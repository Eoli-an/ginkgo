In all of the previous files cg was automatically replaced into bicg. Ensure there is no inconsistency.

All the imported code was commented and TODO items were generated in the new files.
Check all the modified files for '// TODO (script):' items
e.g. by using grep -HR '// TODO (script):' /home/dennis/ginkgo_bicg/ginkgo/dev_tools/scripts/../..
